# About the project

The move.it project was developed during the fourth edition of the Next Level Week event. ( 2021 Feb 22, 2021 Feb 28 ).

# How does it work

The application will randomly generate a challenge, using the sentences in the [challenges.json](https://github.com/arthur-lage/moveit/blob/main/challenges.json) file.
It was developed with the idea of helping people that spend a lot of time in the computer. 

After clicking the Start cicle button, the timer will start to decrease. As it reaches 0, a sound will be played telling the user there is a new challenge waiting for them.

The app data (exp, level, completed challenges) is currently stored in your browser cookies.

---

The app has a leveling system, so the user will receive experience everytime he completes a new challenge.

---

The app will ask your permission to show notifications, they are used to warn you there is a new challenge.
